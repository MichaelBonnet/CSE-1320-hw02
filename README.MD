the folder 'professor_files' contains all files posted by the professor that pertain to this assignment.

the file 'abstract.txt' is a text file that explains the assignment's goals in terms of what was to be achieved and what was to be learned,   along with some implementation/good practice comments and thanks. This file was made as a "code report" to make up for deleting
  a question about it that I posted on /r/C_Programming.

the file 'hw02_bonnet_michael.c' is the main .c file for the assignment and the single file I turned in.
